In the quiet of the morning, whispers of life unfold,
The earth awakens gently, its stories yet untold.
Each heartbeat marks a rhythm, a promise to begin,
Through valleys deep and endless, or mountains steep and thin.
The journey shapes the traveler, the road both harsh and kind,
For within the path we wander lies the treasure we must find.
