Ad astra per aspera, we strive through trials unkind,
A journey paved in shadows, yet stars we seek to find.
Through fleeting winds and echoes, our voices carve their way,
To light that breaks the darkness, igniting a brighter day.
Each step holds hope eternal, a dream that softly gleams,
For life's a path of purpose, woven from fragile dreams.
